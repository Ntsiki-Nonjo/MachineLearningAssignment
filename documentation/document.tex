	\subsection{Decision Tree}
	\subsubsection{Description}
	
	Decision Trees are used to classify data, the classification can either be categorical or continuous. They are a type of Supervised Machine Learning. The tree can be described by decision nodes and leaves. The leaves describe the final outcomes, and the decision nodes are where the data is split\cite{decision-tree-explanation}.
	
	\subsubsection{How data was handled}
	
	The following was done to prepare the data:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Headers were added and saved to a new file \href{run:../data/adult.csv}{adult.csv}
		\item Rows that had missing variables were removed from the data set.
		\item Redundant attributes/columns were removed, i.e: education-num
		\item Irrelevant columns were removed
		\begin{itemize}
			\item {\bfseries Final Weight} ({\bfseries fnlwgt}) weight does not necessarily correlate with income\cite{weight-and-income}.
			\item {\bfseries Capital Gains/Losses} ({\bfseries capital-gain/capital-loss}) including assets and investments wastes computation resources\cite{income-vs-capital}.
			\item {\bfseries Native Country} ({\bfseries native-country}) obvious, and would waste computation resources.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Continuous variables were made categorial
		\begin{itemize}
			\item {\bfseries Age} ({\bfseries age}) 3 groups namely, see reference\cite{age-groups}.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item {\bfseries Baby Boomers} ({\bfseries baby-boomers}) 50 years old and upwards
				\item {\bfseries Generation X} ({\bfseries generation-x}) between 35 and 50 years old
				\item {\bfseries Millennials} ({\bfseries millennials}) between 17 and 34 years old
			\end{itemize}
			\item {\bfseries Work Hours} ({\bfseries hours-per-week}) 3 groups, see reference\cite{work-hours}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item {\bfseries Part-Time} ({\bfseries part-time}) less than 37 hours
				\item {\bfseries Full-Time} ({\bfseries full-time}) 37-40 hours
				\item {\bfseries Overtime} ({\bfseries overtime}) more than 40 hours
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		\item Reduced number of education levels to 7 groups using the United State's education level system, see references
		\begin{itemize}
			\item {\bfseries Preschool} ({\bfseries preschool}) values Preschool\cite{education-level}
			\item {\bfseries Elementary School} ({\bfseries elementary}) values 1st-4th\cite{education-level}
			\item {\bfseries Middle School} ({\bfseries middle}) values 5th-6th, 7th-8th\cite{education-level}
			\item {\bfseries High School} ({\bfseries middle}) values 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, HS-grad\cite{education-level}
			\item {\bfseries Undergraduate} ({\bfseries undergrad}) values Bachelors\cite{undergrad}, Assoc-acdm\cite{associate-degree}
			\item {\bfseries College} ({\bfseries college}) values Some-college\cite{difference-between-education-levels}, Assoc-voc\cite{vocational-school}
			\item {\bfseries Postgraduate} ({\bfseries postgrad}) values Prof-school, Masters, Doctorate\cite{postgrad}

	\subsection{Gaussian Na\"{\i}ve Bayes}
	\subsubsection{Description}
	Gaussian Na\"{\i}ve Bayes is one of Na\"{\i}ve Bayes modelling algorithms used for classification with an assumption of normal distribution of the data features.
	\subsubsection{How data was handled}
	Considering that we had some categorical data and given the fact that Gaussian Na\"{\i}ve Bayes works with continuous input data, a label encoder method had to be imported from the sklearn python library in order to convert the categorical data into continuous data. In other words strings matching the category where encoded into numbers.This was needed to allow the GaussianNB() method from the sklearn.naive bayes library to fit the training data into the model. Also the data had to include non-nulls thus a dropna() method was used to remove any missing values in the dataset. Column headers also had to be added into the dataset which mirrored the attributes given to us from the dataset repository (\url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult}). Afterwards training and testing data were split with a test size ratio of 0.2 produced at random, this allowed us to fit the non-biased training data into the Gaussian Naive Bayes model.
	\subsubsection{Reasons} 
	Since we are given a classification problem, Gaussian Na\"{\i}ve Bayes is a simple and efficient model to implement given that it is one-dimensional. Also from a coding perspective, the algorithm is quick to implement as there is support from the sklearn python library. The Na\"{\i}ve Bayes algorithm works well with large datasets giving an almost accurate and fast way of prediction
	\subsubsection{Performance}
	As stated above the algorithm models large data quickly and efficiently. With our dataset the model produced an accuracy level of 0.804514742014742.
